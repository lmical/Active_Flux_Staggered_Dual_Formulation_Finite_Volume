A New Semi-Discrete Finite-Volume Active Flux Method for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws

In this work, we present a novel Active Flux framework for hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations. Given two different formulations of the system under investigation, a conservative and a primitive (nonconservative) one, we discretize them on overlapping staggered meshes. Both conserved and primitive variables are discretized via cell averages over such staggered meshes. In particular, the primitive cell averages are used to reconstruct point values, which are suitably employed for the computation of the needed fluxes for the conservative formulation. In order to prevent convergence to incorrect solutions, typical of methods directly working on primitive formulations, we introduce a novel conservative post-processing that provides a suitable coupling of the two sets of considered variables, guaranteeing conservation and hence a correct handling of discontinuities. The approach is numerically validated on several benchmarks for the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics.
